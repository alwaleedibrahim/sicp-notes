# Preface
**The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs**
is the entry-level subject in computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

>“**Computer Science**” is not a science and that its significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called *procedural epistemology* the study of the structure of knowledge from an **imperative** point of view, as opposed to the more **declarative** point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of **“what is.”** Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of **“how to.”**

# 1 Building Abstractions with Procedures
>Thee acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three: 
>1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made. 
>2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations. 
>3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.

- *Computational process* are abstract beings that inhabit computers. As they evolve processes manipulate other abstract things called *data*. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a *program*, which is written in *a programming language*.
### Programming in Lisp
- We will use in this book the programming language Lisp. 
- Lisp is an acronym for **LISt Processing**.
- Lisp is a practical programming language. A Lisp interpreter is a machine that carries out processes described in the Lisp language. 
- Lisp is by now a family of dialects, which, while sharing most of the original features, may differ from one another in significant
ways. The dialect of Lisp used in this book is called **Scheme**.
- **If Lisp is not a mainstream language, why are we using it as the framework for our discussion of programming?** Because the language possesses unique features that make it an excellent medium for studying important programming constructs and data structures and for relating them to the linguistic features that support them.The most significant of these features is the fact that Lisp descriptions of processes, called procedures, can themselves be represented and manipulated as Lisp data. The importance of this is that there are powerful program-design techniques that rely on the ability to blur the traditional distinction between “passive” data and “active” processes. As we shall discover, Lisp’s flexibility in handling procedures as data makes it one of the most convenient languages in existence for exploring these techniques. The ability to represent procedures as data also makes Lisp an excellent language for writing programs that must manipulate other programs as data, such as the interpreters and compilers that support computer languages. Above and beyond these considerations, programming in Lisp is great fun.
