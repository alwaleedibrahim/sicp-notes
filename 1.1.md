# Preface
**The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs**
is the entry-level subject in computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

>“**Computer Science**” is not a science and that its significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called *procedural epistemology* the study of the structure of knowledge from an **imperative** point of view, as opposed to the more **declarative** point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of **“what is.”** Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of **“how to.”**

# 1 Building Abstractions with Procedures
>Thee acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three: 
>1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made. 
>2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations. 
>3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.

- *Computational process* are abstract beings that inhabit computers. As they evolve processes manipulate other abstract things called *data*. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a *program*, which is written in *a programming language*.
### Programming in Lisp
- We will use in this book the programming language Lisp. 
- Lisp is an acronym for **LISt Processing**.
- Lisp is a practical programming language. A Lisp interpreter is a machine that carries out processes described in the Lisp language. 
- Lisp is by now a family of dialects, which, while sharing most of the original features, may differ from one another in significant
ways. The dialect of Lisp used in this book is called **Scheme**.
- **If Lisp is not a mainstream language, why are we using it as the framework for our discussion of programming?** Because the language possesses unique features that make it an excellent medium for studying important programming constructs and data structures and for relating them to the linguistic features that support them.The most significant of these features is the fact that Lisp descriptions of processes, called procedures, can themselves be represented and manipulated as Lisp data. The importance of this is that there are powerful program-design techniques that rely on the ability to blur the traditional distinction between “passive” data and “active” processes. As we shall discover, Lisp’s flexibility in handling procedures as data makes it one of the most convenient languages in existence for exploring these techniques. The ability to represent procedures as data also makes Lisp an excellent language for writing programs that must manipulate other programs as data, such as the interpreters and compilers that support computer languages. Above and beyond these considerations, programming in Lisp is great fun.

## 1.1 Elements of programming
A powerful programming language serves as a framework within which we organize our ideas about processes. Every powerful language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:
- **primitive expressions**, which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with,
- **means of combination**, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and
- **means of abstraction**, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units

## 1.1.1 Expressions
One easy way to get started at programming is to examine some typical interactions with an interpreter for the Scheme dialect of Lisp. Imagine that you are sitting at a computer terminal. You type an *expression*, and the interpreter responds by displaying the result of its evaluating that expression.
One kind of primitive expression you might type is a number. If you present Lisp with a number

`486`

the interpreter will respond by printing 

*```486```*

(Throughout this book, when we wish to emphasize the distinction between the input typed by the user and the response printed by the interpreter, we will show the latter in slanted characters.)

Expressions representing numbers may be combined with an expression representing a primitive procedure (such as + or \*) to form a compound expression that represents the application of the procedure to those numbers. For example:

`(+ 137 349)`

*`486`*

Expressions such as these, formed by delimiting a list of expressions
within parentheses in order to denote procedure application, are called
*combinations*. The leftmost element in the list is called the *operator*, and
the other elements are called *operands*. The value of a combination is
obtained by applying the procedure specified by the operator to the *arguments* that are the values of the operands.

The convention of placing the operator to the left of the operands
is known as *prefix notation*, One of its advantages
is that it can accommodate procedures that may take an arbitrary number of arguments, as in the following example:

`(+ 21 35 12 7)`

*`75`*

A second advantage of prefix notation is that it extends in a straightforward way to allow combinations to be nested, that is, to have combinations whose elements are themselves combinations:

`(+ (* 3 5) (- 10 6))`

*`19`*

The interpreter always operates in
the same basic cycle: It reads an expression from the terminal, evaluates
the expression, and prints the result. This mode of operation is often
expressed by saying that the interpreter runs in a *read-eval-print loop*.

## 1.1.2 Naming and the environment
In the Scheme dialect of Lisp, we name things with define:

`(define size 2)`

we can refer to the value 2 by name:

`size`

*`2`*

define is our language’s simplest **means of abstraction**, for it allows us to use simple names to refer to the results of compound operations.

The interpreter must maintain some sort of memory that keeps track of the name-object pairs. This memory is called the *environment* (more precisely the global environment, since we will see later that a computation may involve a numberof different environments).
