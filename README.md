# SICP Notes
I learned about Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs textbook from [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#programming). I decided to take notes as I go through it.

## What is SICP
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs is a computer science textbook by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professors Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman. It is known as the Wizard Book in hacker culture. SICP is available online for free both as a [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html), and as a set of [MIT video lectures](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/). I recommend [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7BcsI5ueSNFPCEisbaoQ0kXIDX9rR5FF) for the lectures.
